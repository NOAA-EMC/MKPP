# Multiphase Kinetic PreProcessor (MKPP) Engine

MKPP (Multiphase Kinetic PreProcessor) is a highly optimized, Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Python compiler that translates atmospheric chemistry mechanisms (defined via OpenAtmos YAML) into Exascale-ready block-sparse Kokkos C++ headers for a Unified Jacobian using SymPy.

## Mechanisms Included
- **Chapman Cycle** (`chapman.yaml`)
- **Small Stratospheric** (`small_strato.yaml`)
- **Carbon** (`carbon.yaml`)
- **GOCART** (`gocart.yaml`)
- **SAPRC** mechanisms (`saprc99.yaml`, `saprcnov.yaml`)

## Building and Testing
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DMKPP_ENABLE_KOKKOS_KERNELS=ON
ninja
ctest
```

### Compiler CLI Options
- `--simd-backend {native,kokkos_batched}`: Select SIMD vector engine backend for `Wide<W>` (default: `native`). `kokkos_batched` uses KokkosKernels 5.0+ hardware-tuned SIMD vector wrappers.
- `--batch-width <W>`: Set SIMD vector lane width (e.g. 4, 8, 16).
